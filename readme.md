# Flood Risk and Food Security in Dar Es Salaam

Smith, L.W.

## Abstract

This analysis assessed the extent to which residences in Dar Es Salaam would lose access to food sources in the case of a severe flooding event.
Specifically, I found how much the distance from every residence in Dar Es Salaam to the nearest grocery vendor would increase between an everyday scenario and a severe flood scenario.
The results revealed that flooding has minimal impact on food accessibility, except for in a few small regions.
