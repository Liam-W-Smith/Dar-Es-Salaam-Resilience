# OpenStreetMap Metadata

Professor Holler downloaded point, polygon, line, and road data for the city of Dar Es Salaam from OpenStreetMaps using the batch script and style file in my code folder.
For this analysis, I used only the point and polygon layers.
OpenStreetMaps is an open source mapping project licensed under the Open Data Commons Open Database License.
Anyone can add data points to the database, and the data has been added over a few years.
